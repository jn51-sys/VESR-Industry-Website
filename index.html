            <h2>My Top 4 Personal Values</h2>
            
            <h3>Kindness</h3>
            <p>I believe that treating people with kindness is essential.</p>
            <p>There have been many times I wish people had treated me with kindness, so I want to make sure I always treat others better.</p>
            <p>If I did not treat people with kidness, I would risk becoming the type of person I do not like. Everybody deserves kindness.</p>

            <h3>Respectfulness</h3>
            <p>Treating people with respect is important because we are all working toward the same goal of personal success. Anybody who works hard, no matter what it is they do, deserves respect.</p>
            <p>Similar to kindness, all people deserve respect. I treat others with respect in hopes that they will treat me with respect.</p>
            <p>If I did not treat others with respect, I would risk not having respect shown back to me.</p>

            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>I am a firm believer in integrity, too many people are willing to betray their core values for various reasons.</p>
            <p>Being uncompromising in my values is something I pride myself on. That is why it is so important to me.</p>
            <p>If I were to betray my values, I would have not be a trustworthy person that others could rely on.</p>

            <h3>Humility</h3>
            <p>Humility is important to me because nobody is successful on their own. We all have help from somewhere, and need to always keep that in mind.</p>
            <p>I understand that I have been dealt a good hand in life. It is important for me to be humble because I know that it is only through my friends and family that I am the person I am today.</p>
            <p>If I did not display humility, I might forget the people that made me who I am now.</p>
