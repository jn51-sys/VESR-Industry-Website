            <p>I am working in the journalism industry. Journalism is the production and distribution of reports on current events, ideas, facts, and people.</p>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>My role in this organization will be that of a writer/reporter. I will conduct interviews and gather information, then condense it into an article to be edited and then published.</p>

            <h2>Ethics</h2>
            <p>Ethics are a cornerstone of journalism. One example of an ethical issue can be a conflict of interest. If you are reporting on an individual or organization that you have strong ties to, it can result in unfair and biased reporting. For this reason, I will not report on any organizations me or my friends are a part of.</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is extremely important for the journalism industry. Journalists handle a lot of sensitive info, and if that information is leaked improperly the journalists could be held accountable. Hackers could also manipulate news sites to take them down or spread false stories passed off as legitimate.</p>
            <p>For this reason, we will use encryption and multi-factor authentication to protect our assets.</p>
